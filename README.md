# CaffeineLite

CaffeineLite is a minimal utility program that prevents your computer from going to sleep.

It has the goal to be as lightweight as possible.

## How it works?

The app sends a F15 key press event (yes, this key exists) every minute, in order to keep the PC active.

## How to make it startup automatically?

You can you use Windows Task Scheduler to set the executable to start during login.

## How much system resources does it use?

The service usually uses less than 1MB of memory.
